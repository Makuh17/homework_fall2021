This repository contains my solutions to the assignments for [Berkeley CS 285: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Control](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).

Based on my interest in RL, I have chosen to self study this course as it appears to be the most comprehensive course on 
Deep RL available.

So far assignments 1-3 have been completed, covering the following topics/algorithms:
 * Imitation learning
 * Policy Gradient methods, including use of baselines
 * Actor-Critic methods
 * Deep Q-learning and Double Deep Q-learning
